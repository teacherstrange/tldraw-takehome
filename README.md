# Instructions

tldraw is working on a new feature for our white-boarding app: **stickers!**

You've been assigned the ticket:

![reference](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-takehome/raw/main/reference.gif)

> Stickers are little shapes that you can stamp down on a drawing to give a quick thumbs up, share some love, vote on a topic, or bring some attention to part of the page. After choosing a sticker, a user can click on the page to place the sticker down.

---

1. In this repository's project, implement the basics of the feature as shown and described above. Use **regular HTML and CSS**. Don't use HTML canvas and don't use any third party libraries like Paper.js. Use emojis for the stickers (🌟, 🔥, 💖, 👍, 👎).
2. Next, think beyond the basic specification written in the ticket. What else does the demo show? What else might this stickers feature need before it was ready for people to use? Come up with a few ideas. Create issues in your from these issues ofin the form of user stories, for example “as a user I want to delete a sticker”.
3. As a **stretch goal**, pick one of the stories you created in step two and implement it in your app.

Good luck!
