# Stickers!

tldraw is working on a new feature for our white-boarding app: stickers!

You've been assigned the ticket:

> Stickers are little shapes that you can stamp down on a drawing to give a quick thumbs up, share some love, vote on a topic, or bring some attention to part of the page. After choosing a sticker, a user can click on the page to place the sticker down.

1. In this repository's project, implement the basics of the feature as shown and described above. A user should be able to select a sticker and then place their selected sticker with each click. (Note that the stickers are emojis: 🌟, 🔥, 💖, 👍, 👎). Use **regular HTML and CSS for this**. Don't use HTML canvas.
2. Next, think beyond the basic spec. What else does the demo show? What else might this stickers feature need before it was ready for people to use? Come up with a few ideas and write these as user stories, for example “as a user I want to delete a sticker”.
3. As a **stretch goal**, pick one of the stories you created in step two and implement it in your app.
